Write a JAVA application that fulfils the following requirements.
You will have to present your application as well as the source code written for it.

Req_001
The application shall be written and build in JAVA.

Req_002
The application shall have a graphical user interface implemented with JavaFX.

Req_003
The application shall be executable on Microsoft Windows.

Req_004
The application shall have a function that runs “tasklist” as a console command.
The output of this command shall be returned to the application and show the following information
(of each task, sorted by used memory) within the graphical user interface:
Name
PID
Used Memory

Req_005
The application shall provide a manner of handling different OS language settings
which might affect the result of the “tasklist” command.

Req_006
The application shall have a function that removes any duplicates from the listed tasks
(assuming the name is the identifier – ignoring the PID).
Tasks of the same name shall be grouped together and the used memory aggregated.

Req_007
The application shall have a function that exports the cleaned list of tasks (see Req_005)
into a XML file abiding by the following scheme:
<tasks>
    <task>
        <name></name>
        <memory></memory>
    </task>
</tasks>

Req_008
The application shall utilize a SaveFileDialog form (or something equivalent)
to give the user a method to choose the filename and location of the new xml file.

Req_009
The application shall have a function to re-import the saved XML file and compare the contents
to the data shown in the graphical user interface. Any changes shall be shown in the GUI.

Req_010
The application shall provide a function that exports the gathered data into Microsoft Excel
and generate a chart about the memory usage of tasks.
